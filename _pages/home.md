# Birth
 Born on Aug 22nd, 1942 in Brooklyn, New York to Rose Psaris (née Lang)
 and John Psaris, Tony’s life was defined by his passion for sharing
 his life with others. Tony attended Erasmus Hall High School in
 Brooklyn, New York and then Eastern Military Academy in Cold Spring
 Harbor, Long Island and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. After
 working with his father at the Parkway Grill in Old Westbury, he
 joined the armed services as a Military Policeman in South Korea.

# Marriage
 Tony initially pursued interests in photography but soon returned to
 the restaurant business for the remainder of his working career. While
 working in New York City, he met the love of his life, Rachelle
 “Shelly” Leah Psaris (née Westreich). Tony and Shelly were married on
 Shelly’s birthday, February 7th, 1971.

# Long Island
 After a few years living in Bayport on Long Island, they moved to
 Coram, Long Island with plans to raise their family. Tony worked as
 the Bar Manager at the Harborside Restaurant from 1980-1986 and then
 the Manager of the Royal Oak Diner in Bellport, Long Island from
 1986-2004.

# Paris Diner
 Initially retiring in 2004, he followed the siren call to reopen the
 Paris Diner previously owned and run by his father. His dedication to
 this effort saw him make the 1.5 hour car ride to Brooklyn and back
 every day. Even his diagnosis and treatment for prostate cancer would
 not stop his passion for running his own restaurant. Having brought
 the diner back to life in his childhood neighborhood, he retired again
 (this time permanently) in 2008. Reopening the Paris Diner would be
 Tony’s proudest accomplishment.

# Avanti R1
 Tony loved the cars of his youth and sailing. He spent his retirement
 sailing his C&C 29 from Mount Sinai Harbor and continuously improving
 his Studebaker Avanti R1, winning first place at a competition in
 Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in 2011.

# Religion
 Tony was a proud Unitarian Universalist and spent many years as a
 member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Stony Brook, Long
 Island. Beginning in 1983, he and Shelly also spent many summers at
 the Life On A Star 2 conference on Star Island in Portsmouth, New
 Hampshire. They were proud chairs of the conference in 1996 and
 continued to attend until 2019. Even though he was unable to attend
 during the final years of his life, Tony always considered Star Island
 to be his “spirit’s home”.

# Fritz
 Late in life, Tony decided he needed a canine companion to see him
 through the remaining years of his life. Fritz, the Giant Schnauzer,
 arrived from Oregon in December 2018 and never left his side. Fritz
 brought great stories, funny pictures and years of joy for Tony. His
 favorite Giant Schnauzer joke was: “Silence is golden. Unless you
 have a Giant Schnauzer.  Then silence is suspicious. Very very
 suspicious.”

# Passing
 At the age of 82, Anthony "Tony" Ferdinand Psaris passed away
 peacefully on Jan 11th, 2025.
